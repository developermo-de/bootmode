Today I am in Chicago for the Google Games. Although we only have 4 people, I feel like we can still do well. I will be updating this during the day.

#### Trivia Round

The Lightning Round went pretty well. The Trivia Packet was more diffucult, but featured interesting questions like Magic Cards vs Olympic Gold Medal Power Lifters. My favorite catagory was Taylor Swift Billboard #1 Singles.

#### Puzzle Round

This round was brutal. We decided to split things up and only started working together when we had 30 minutes left. As a result we only finished one puzzle (But we got 20 points for it :D). We really felt the lack of our fifth member here.
