Today I am in Chicago for the Google Games. Although we only have 4 people, I feel like we can still do well. I will be updating this during the day./

#### Trivia Round

The Lightning Round went pretty well. The Trivia Packet was more diffucult, but featured interesting questions like Magic Cards vs Olympic Gold Medal Power Lifters. My favorite catagory was Taylor Swift Billboard #1 Singles.

#### Puzzle Round

This round was brutal. We decided to split things up and only started working together when we had 30 minutes left. As a result we only finished one puzzle (But we got 20 points for it :D). We really felt the lack of our fifth member here. 

#### Lunch

There was deep dish pizza for lunch. I wasn't very hungry so I traded my spot in line for a bottle of soylent.

#### Word Association

This catagory was very fun. Basically we needed to fill in a nodes in a word map. Whenever you get a node, new branches to new nodes are revealed. Our points for this section was slightly above average.

#### Coding Challenge

We passed 7 challenges on the coding portion, landing us solidly in the middle of the pack. 

#### Building Challenge

Our marble run device was put together hastily, and ended up failing ): We tried to make a very gentle sloped run, but what we didn't count on is how inprecise straws are as a building material, as well as how hard taping things together was. Some interesting designs I saw includinga funnel with straws stuck through to slow the marble down, as well as a half pipe that let the marble roll into the cup when it ran out of momentum.

#### Final Thoughts

We ended up getting 10th place overall. If we had a 5th person we would have for sure done much better. This is the kind of competition where having an extra brain plugging away at problems would help a lot. 

Next year we'll do better for sure, and I won't forget my swag on the bus. 

If any of you are even considering going to a Google Games in the future, go, it's a lot of fun. :D
