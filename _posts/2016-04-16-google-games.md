Today I am in Chicago for the Google Games. Although we only have 4 people, I feel like we can still do well. I will be updating this during the day.

#### Trivia Round

The Lightning Round went pretty well. The Trivia Packet was more diffucult, but featured interesting questions like Magic Cards vs Olympic Gold Medal Power Lifters. My favorite catagory was Taylor Swift Billboard #1 Singles.

#### Puzzle Round

This round was brutal. We decided to split things up and only started working together when we had 30 minutes left. As a result we only finished one puzzle (But we got 20 points for it :D). We really felt the lack of our fifth member here. 

#### Lunch

There was deep dish pizza for lunch. Too bad I wasn't hungry.

#### Coding Challenge

We did decently on the coding challenge, about average.

#### Building Challenge

Our marble run device was put together hastily, and ended up failing ):

#### Final Thoughts

While we would have done better if we had a fifth person to help us, I am mostly satisfied by how we did. Next year will be better. 

If any of you are even considering going to a Google Games in the future, just go.
