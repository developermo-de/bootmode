Today I am in Chicago for the Google Games. Although we only have 4 people, I feel like we can still do well. I will be updating this during the day.

#### Trivia Round

The Lightning Round went pretty well. The Trivia Packet was more diffucult, but featured interesting questions like Magic Cards vs Olympic Gold Medal Power Lifters. My favorite catagory was Taylor Swift Billboard #1 Singles.
